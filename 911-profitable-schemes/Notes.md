<h2>profitable-schemes Notes</h2><hr>optimised 

the only difference we keep an upper bound for total profti that it never cross the minprofit 

that is 
as we follow take not take , approach , when we cross minprofit we reduce it to the minprofit , as we bother about knowing if the amount collected is atleast minprofit , and not bothered about exact amount, 

thus the total profit constrained to 100 than 100*100, which case gave time and memory limit exceeded
