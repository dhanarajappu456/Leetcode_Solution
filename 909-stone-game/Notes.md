<h2>stone-game Notes</h2><hr>you can do this with 2d dp with alice ,  , you don't need the paramete indicating , who is playing , since it can be obtained from the length of current array 

that is when length of current array is even , it is alice who play , so we consider taking the score at either end ,
else it is bob who plays , so the values at the either end cannot be taken by alice
